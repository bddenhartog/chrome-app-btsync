# BitTorrent Sync GUI

BitTorrent Sync GUI is a [Chrome Application](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps) for running [BitTorrent Sync's](http://www.getsync.com/) web interface.

#### Key Features
- **Runs on any Desktop OS**  
    This single application runs on Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux - anywhere that Chrome (or Chromium) can run.
- **Easy to use**  
    This loads the web interface for BitTorrent Sync, which is the de facto way to interact with BitTorrent Sync. Think of this as a frame for the web interface -- there is no additional learning required!
- **Easy to access**  
    You can put a shortcut in your start menu or task bar (windows), on your dock (linux/mac osx), or on your desktop. This makes opening up the web interface a much smoother, easier process.
- **Feels like a native application**  
    Run the BitTorrent Sync GUI as a standalone application -- no more sorting through your tabs trying to find it!

## Installation

The preferred method of installation is to install via the Web Store -- don't let the word "store" fool you, it's 100% free.
